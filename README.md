What is a snapshot?
-----------
A "snapshot" is a an export of a part of our codebase at a particular point in time. It is not necessarily complete, nor is it guaranteed to be runnable. 
It is also liable to be out of date with our current codebase, and it is possible that we will not update the snapshot in the future.
